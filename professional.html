                <h3>Joint Mobilization</h3>
                <p>Joint mobilization is a method of manual therapy to improve joint mobility and function. The technique involves applying gentle, controlled forces to the joint in certain directions to strengthen its movement and reduce pain. Joint mobilization can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including arthritis, tendinitis, and musculoskeletal injuries.</p>

                <h3>Dry Acupuncture</h3>
                <p>Dry acupuncture is a technique in which needles are used to affect areas of the body known as trigger points. It is very effective in the treatment of chronic pain, headaches, stress and other conditions. Compared to trigger point massage, dry acupuncture can affect deeper layers of muscles and connective tissue, providing more targeted and lasting relief.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Deep Tissue</h3>
                <p>Deep tissue massage is a technique that uses strong pressure to affect the deep layers of connective tissue, known as fascia. The purpose of the massage is to relieve tension and pain in the muscles and fascia, improve the range of motion and promote healing. One of the special advantages of the technique is that it helps to stretch the fascia, which can be useful for those who experience tightness and pain, as well as for athletes who want to improve their performance and flexibility.</p>
